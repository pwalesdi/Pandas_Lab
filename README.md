# Pandas_Lab

This lab didn't have anything explanatory in it. It was a test of your ability to complete processes using pandas dataframes. We used a data set comprised of measurements of different flowers. 

There wasn't any analysis completed rather just the ability to create columns, merge dataframes, and do multiple types of plots.
